Hey it's Cameron. I worked on some of the assets, like the text screens.

Anna here. I feel like I did more than half the work on this project. Pretty much all the comments in the code are from me.

This is Alex. I worked on the assets and helped with the menu and audio. 

Hello, this is Alexis. I was in charge of project management, audio, and helping others as much as I can.
